# Stock Chart Visualizer

This project was completed as part of an intro to computer science course during my freshman year at UB. It is a simple web app that allows you to enter any stock ticker and obtain the relevant price history and volume charts. There are also timeline options ranging from one day to five years.

Concepts including dynamic routing, AJAX requests, pure HTML, and use of third-party packages and APIs were applied.
